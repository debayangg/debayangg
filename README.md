## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- Watch one piece, it's the best anime.
- I love contributing to open source and reading the code.
- Mostly code in JavaScript and Go along with C/C++ for low-level applications(have coded slight bit of nasm x86).
- I like using Linux, dont want to work because I heard real companies use Windows/Mac. Real world scary.
